abstract: Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions
to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical
computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power
consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial
programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of
the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM
achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a
general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously
computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this
concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state
solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without
ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the
number of spin. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic uncon-
strained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in nonâ€“von
Neumann hardware.
