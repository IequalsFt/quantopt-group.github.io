abstract: As early as about 2400 years ago, Mozi (original name Mo Di, Latinized as Micius), an ancient Chinese scientist, proposed the theory of pinhole imaging that demonstrates the fundamental principle of light behavior. About 700 years ago, Marco Polo, an Italian explorer, traveled to China along the Silk Road, marveled at the economic prosperity and the advanced technology of Hangzhou City in China, and described Hangzhou as “the most beautiful and splendid city in the world”. About 5 years ago, with the support of the China-proposed Belt-and-Road Initiative, it was in Hangzhou City that Professor Pavlos Savvidis, an Armenian-born Greek physicist, chose to work with more of his Chinese counterparts and took on the challenge of building a new research laboratory on quantum optoelectronics. He used to study and work in the UK, the USA, and Greece, but now in New China’s first new type of research university supported by the society—Westlake University. Traveling from West to East, traversing from one civilization to another, Professor Pavlos Savvidis delves into his unwavering quest for light in this issue of “Light People”, and discusses his tireless pursuit of excellence in the field of optoelectronics, which has garnered him widespread citation, recognition, and contribution to the global scientific community.
