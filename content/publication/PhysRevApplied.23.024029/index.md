abstract: Exciton polaritons are inherently tunable systems with an adjustable potential landscape. In this work, we show that exciton-polariton condensates can be selectively localized in a fixed optically induced periodic lattice with uniform potential depth, by judiciously controlling a second focused pump of very small size away from the lattice chain. Specifically, the localized polariton condensate can be tuned among different potential traps by adjusting the relative distance between the small pump spot and the potential lattice. The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump spot and its combination with the fixed larger pump spot for the potential creation induce the mode selection determined by the gain profile, the group velocity, and the potential distribution within the system. The localization of the exciton-polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice and, thus, even in a slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates. Our results illuminate a path to the remote manipulation of exciton-polariton bosonic condensates in fixed integrated photonic chips and circuits.
