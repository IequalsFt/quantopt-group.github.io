Zhen Cui（崔祯）received a bachelor's degree in physics from Southern University of Science and Technology in 2019; from 2019 to 2020, he worked as a research assistant at Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering. In August 2020, he was admitted as a doctoral student by West Lake University, engaged in polariton related research.

Zhen mainly studies the physical realization of quantum computing under the polariton system. In 2018, he entered the Shenzhen Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering to engage in related research work on superconducting quantum devices. He designed and fabricated Josephson parametric amplifiers. As the first attempt by SUSTech undergraduates in superconducting quantum devices, this work was rated as 2019 Excellent graduation design of Southern University of Science and Technology. In July 2019, Zhen served as research assistant of Shenzhen Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering, and followed the professor Georgios A. Siviloglou to study the numerical simulation method of quantum computing gate operation under the optical tweezers system.
