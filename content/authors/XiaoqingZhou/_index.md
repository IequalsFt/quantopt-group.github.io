Xiaoqing Zhou was born in Hangzhou. She graduated from Zhejiang University Zhu Kezhen Honors College, majored in Electronics and Information Engineering. She went to Technical University of Munich (TUM) and graduated with a Master of Science degree in Microwave Engineering. She then joined Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (MPQ) in Garching-bei-München, working in the Laser Spectroscopy Division. In 2013, she obtained her doctor degree from Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), working in the field of nano-electromechanics, which uses quantum mechanical processes such as parametric frequency conversion or radiation pressure quantum effects in fundamental quantum science and technology experiments. She was active in K12 STEM education for several years and has been gravitated by the booming research activities in Westlake University and joined this center in December 2019.
