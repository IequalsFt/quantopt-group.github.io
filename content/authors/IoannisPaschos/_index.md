Ioannis Paschos is from Paros, a small island of Greece. He obtained his B.S.c diploma in Physics from the University of Crete while in 2013 he received his M.S.c diploma in Nanobiophysics from the Technical University of Dresden focused on topological insulating materials. During this period, he had the opportunity of being part of highly recognized institutes such as the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, the Biotechnology Center of the TU Dresden and the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW). In 2019, he received his PhD in Material Science and Technology from the University of Crete, where he devoted himself on the study and development of novel polaritonic devices. As an experimental physicist of the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (I.E.S.L-FORTH) his main experimental research activities were focused on condensed matter physics, quantum optics and optoelectronics, laser physics and non-linear dynamics. His current research activities are focused on the development and realization of hybrid organic-inorganic polariton LEDs and polariton condensate lattices for quantum simulation.
