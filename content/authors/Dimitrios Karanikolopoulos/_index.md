Dimitrios Karanikolopoulos hails from Kastoria, a northern town of Greece. Having received his Diploma in Physics from the University of Crete (UOC) he pursued Graduate studies for his MSc in Photonics in the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). Being a collaboration among acclaimed academic establishments, namely, the University of Barcelona (UB), the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) and the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO), this curriculum allowed him to delve into the realms of quantum optics and nanophotonics while also building an experimental background working for his thesis on near-field microscopy.

He was offered his PhD from the Physics Department of the UOC for his work on solid state laser physics carried out in the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL-FORTH). The focus of the experimental efforts was on time-resolved studies of transition metal oxides for use in optoelectronic devices and green energy applications.

He is currently dedicated in research on quantum simulations, to that end he is developing experimental setups for the generation and manipulation of spin lattices and coupled polariton condensates.
