Pavlos Savvidis has received the B.Sc. in Physics of the University of Athens. He obtained his doctoral degree in Experimental Condensed Matter and Laser Physics from the University of Southampton in 2001 creating the first polariton amplifier. From 2002 to 2004 he was a DARPA funded post-doctoral associate at the Department of Physics of University of California, Santa Barbara, USA, working on the terahertz dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures and Bloch Oscillators. In 2004 he was appointed Assistant Professor at the Department of Materials Science and Technology of the University of Crete. Since 2004, he is affiliated researcher of the Microelectronics Research Group of the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (I.E.S.L.) of FORTH and is receiver of FORTH 2017 researcher award. In 2014, he was awarded the prestigious 1 year Leverhulme Fellowship to work as visiting Professor at Cavendish Labs, University of Cambridge and in 2017 received a 2-year visiting Professor Fellowship at ITMO University. He accepted the offer as Associate Professor at Westlake University in 2019 and has been ptomoted to the position of Full Professor since 2023, and his research is focused on experimental polaritonics.

He published over 100 research papers which appeared in high impact journals such as Nature, Science, 2 Nature Mat., 1 Nature Physics, 1, Nature Phot., 1 Nature Comm, PNAS, 8 PRL which have been cited over 4800 times. h-index of 33 (Google Science).He is inventor of polariton amplifier and demonstrated the concept of polariton LED at room temperature. Referee for leading physical journals Nature, Nature Mat, Phys, Comm, Phys. Rev. Lett. Coordinated numerous national and European research projects as well as ERC starting grant.
